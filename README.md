Operant box codes for Timed Sequence Task

Set of codes for standard operant boxes equipped with two fixed levers and a feeder  (Med Associates, MED-307A-B1) and operated by Med-PC V software. The code is based on a code originally provided by MedAssociates (MEDLab8 Chain). 

Names of the codes indicate the required sequences of lever presses. Individual inter-press intervals can be defined and easily modified and are logged in great detail (ie. different types of incorrect presses are distinguished and recorded separately). See detailed description of the tasks [here](/documentation.pdf).

Detailed description of the algorithms and all logged values can be found below.
Python scripts for the automated analysis of the resulting task logs are available on GitHub [Timed Sequence Task Analysis](https://github.com/mjtecka/Timed-Sequence-Task-Analysis).
